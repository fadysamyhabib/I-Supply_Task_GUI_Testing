# Web Automation Testing with Selenium

This project demonstrates web automation testing using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and page object models (POM). It includes various tests for common web applications, such as Google search and file upload.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selenium-web-automation.git

2. Configure the WebDriver
The WebDriver is managed by WebDriverManager, so thereâ€™s no need to manually download browser drivers. It will automatically handle the setup when tests are run.

3. Run the Tests

4. View Test Reports
TestNG generates a detailed HTML report located in the /test-output directory after the tests have completed.
